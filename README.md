First off, thank you.

I have two linked databases - EmployeeModel and BreakModel. The EmployeeModel has a field called "DisplayName".... I have those plugged into
the view model. On the Home/Index page you'll see a placeholder drop-down. That drop-down needs to be filled with the display names from the
Employee model only if NotActive == false. When the user submits it, it adds it to the BreakModel database with a time stamp in the TimeEntered field.

That dropdown you're creating needs to be re-used many many times, so please help me make it so that drop-down populates and I can use it in all
the places I'll need it used.

Thank you!!!!
